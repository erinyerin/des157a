                    In the 1980s, the only way to reach the scenic but remote Anmok Beach in Gangneung, South Korea was by taxi. As instant coffee machines lined the beach to help fuel the taxi drivers working late nights, local coffee roasters began to make their homes in the little city and established the now-famous Cafe Street.

                    Koreans have a phrase - “eol-juk-ah” – which is an abbreviation of “frozen to death for iced coffee.” Perhaps due to a culture that loves efficiency, Koreans love iced Americanos. For students or office workers on the rush, an iced coffee lets you sip without needing to let it cool, and you can carry it with you all day without diluting the milk or sugar, making it the perfect caffeine fix to carry all day.

                <p>
                    Try enjoying a cold, refreshing iced Americano and the view of a rocky sea through the floor-to-ceiling windows of a cafe on Cafe Street.

                    Nicknamed ‘City of Stars,’ LA’s burgeoning movie industry attracted ambitious, starry-eyed creatives and long days fueled by... coffee! 
                </p>

                <p>
                    LA’s vibrant culture is shaped by the kaleidoscope of immigrant communities who call the city home, and you can find lots of cafes inspired by Latin American, Italian, and Korean cafe culture.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Enjoy the balmy weather and gaze at the stars both in the sky and the streets with a fizzy espresso tonic as effervescent as a dream. Pour one shot of espresso over tonic water, carefully to preserve the crema and avoid a mess of bubbles. This one adds a bright Korean plum syrup called Maesil-chung on the bottom, adding sweetness and health benefits like detox and fatigue relief – perfect for a city central to California’s wellness culture.   .

                    Sacramento – the middle child of California’s cities, overshadowed by her influencer sister Los Angeles and startup hustler brother San Francisco. Yet she’s incredibly charming once you get to know her.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Known as America’s farm-to-fork capital, this philosophy extends to Sacramento’s coffee scene as well – local roasters like Temple Coffee, Pachamama Coffee, and Camellia Coffee Roasters focus on ethically and sustainably sourced coffee and building relationships with small farmers in Latin America and Africa. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Try a creamy latte lightly sweetened with brown sugar, with a double shot of specialty espresso and perfectly foamed local California dairy. Make sure to savor the unique notes of each roast that tell a story about the coffee’s origin and processing techniques!

                    When I arrived in Berlin, my first opportunity to build relationships was ‘Kaffee und Kuchen’ – a classic German ritual of sharing an hour of the afternoon with friends, family, or colleagues over coffee and cake. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    My favorite place for Kaffee und Kuchen in Berlin was Konditorei Buchwald, a 200 year old bakery in the Hansaviertel neighborhood that feels like the cozy living room of a German grandmother. Though they’re known for their layered Baumkuchen, named for their tree growth ring like appearance, any of their cream, fruit, and nut laden cakes make the perfect pair with a cup of coffee. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Grab a friend, old or new, and enjoy a hot Schwarzkafee with a pastry of your choice. By the end of the hour, you’ll be as sweet of a pairing as Kaffee und Kuchen.

                    Many of the world’s famous names worked, relaxed, conversed, exchanged news, and debated in Vienna’s coffee houses. Beethoven, Klimt, Freud, and Trotsky, to name but a few.                </p>
                <p>
                    The classic Viennese coffee drink is the Einspanner, which is a shot of espresso topped generously with sweet, vanilla flavored whipped cream and a sprinkle of cocoa powder. The drink is named after the 19th century one-horse carriage drivers who relied on the drink to keep them warm and alert during their long shifts. The thick layer of cream acted as an insulator against the cold and any bumps along the road. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Travel back in time to the 19th century by enjoying an Einspanner (and maybe a cigarette) on a plush couch or a patio table outdoors. Make sure it’s absolutely overflowing with whipped cream and lots of sugar.

                    Back before Seattle was the vibrant tech hub it’s known as today, it was filled with lumberjacks and fishermen enduring the constant cold drizzle with a cuppa joe to keep them going.                 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, Seattle is filled with coffee roasters, from global conglomerates like Starbucks to smaller local chains like Storyville Coffee, Victrola Coffee Roasters, and Herkimer Coffee brewing up warm fragrant cups to keep the city moving. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Nowadays, you’re more likely to run into a tech bro wearing a Patagonia quarter zip than the rugged, working class men of the past. But when the cold drenches your bones and become hard to shake, there’s nothing as universally comforting as a cup of coffee to warm your hands and heart.
