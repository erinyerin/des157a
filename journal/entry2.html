            The first thing that came to mind in this article’s example of using a scroll bar within an overlay is when I get a pop-up of terms and conditions, and end up checking ‘agree’ without bothering to read any of the content. Some websites have tried to bypass this by making sure I cannot check ‘agree’ without viewing all of the content, but this doesn’t make me actually read it – I just exasperatedly scroll before I can check ‘agree’ and be done with it.
        </p>

        <p>
            In my personal experience, I find that overlays are most useful for enlarging visual content, such as photographs or diagrams, so that they fit nicely into the document flow when minimized but still can be enlarged to be legible. Overlays tend to be less helpful in my opinion for text content – I much prefer a separate page or an accordion menu. An interesting example that the article pointed out that demonstrates a really useful use of overlays for text, however, was about providing context when asking for sensitive information like a zip code. This draws more attention to the information than having it buried in the form might, and builds trust with the user so that the questions do not discourage them from submitting a form.
        </p>

        <p>
            All in all, overuse of overlays can hinder usability and make them feel gimmicky or outdated, but this article provides some great examples of cases where overlay is the best way to present information, and what differentiates them from poor usage.
