            As a student living in the digital age, I fill out a lot of forms– for registration, online quizzes, feedback forms, and more. I notice that when a form is well designed, I don’t notice it, but a poorly designed form stands out like a sore thumb. This article by Salim Ansari discussing best practices for form design illuminated for me the seemingly small choices designers can make to ensure online forms are as seamless an experience as possible.

            One thing Ansari points out is that users will abandon a poorly designed form without filling it out entirely, and notes that designers can encourage users to finish a form by keeping it short, asking easy questions first, and breaking up larger forms into smaller steps. I think the last part is especially helpful; I usually appreciate having a progress bar that lets me know how much more of the form I have to fill out, because otherwise a form can feel endless. I also think it’s interesting that easier, straightforward questions should come first– often, if a form asks high effort questions in the beginning I might not begin at all, but if they come towards the end where I’ve finished most of the form already, I can imagine a sunk-cost fallacy sets in and encourages me to finish it out.

            I understand why it’s best practice to have matching keyboards and to hide sensitive information by default, but these tend to be sources of frustration in my personal experience. I tend to always check “show password” if it’s an option, and when it’s not an option it takes me multiple attempts to get my password correct because of typos and being unaware of where the typo occurred. Matching keyboards can be helpful, but often I’m more comfortable navigating the standard keyboard layout I am used to by muscle memory, and it feels like an extra step to have to adjust to the new layout. I suppose these instances demonstrate that there’s always going to be individual differences among user preference.

            <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google Fonts'</a> filter sidebar is a really user friendly form from my experience. I like that the most relevant options, like sample text and type size, are at the very top, and I have the option of scrolling down for more specific filter options that can also collapse for a more compact view. The filters are clear on what is selected– the button gets highlighted and a ‘Filter’ tag appears at the top of the search results. Also, the drop-down menus for language and writing system allows the user to both scroll and type to search, making navigating a large number of choices easy, and selected options populate at the top of the list to make it easy to see what’s selected.
