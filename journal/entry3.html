            I thought the New York Times article was really interesting because it treats interacting with photographs like an I Spy game – how much detail can you gather from an image, and what conclusions can you draw about the situation from the information you can find? In visual communication, and especially in UI/UX, there’s an expectation that things are straightforward and clear, reducing friction as much as possible so the user can find what they are looking for efficiently and quickly. However, I think this more exploratory, curiosity driven approach to images has really interesting implications for how we interact with a digital 2D space – it engages us, forces us to think critically, and draw our own conclusions rather than having everything spoonfed to us. It’s cool to see this perspective from a news outlet, especially because in this era of AI slop mindless consumption and blind trust in the content we see can be dangerous.

            One website I found that utilizes web images in an interesting way is <a href="https://en.dinotaeng.com/">Dinotaeng</a>, which to the best of my knowledge is an ecommerce site selling merchandise for a character line. This points out the first drawback of using novel image interactions in a website – by subverting expectations it makes it harder to immediately know what the purpose of the website is. Dinotaeng treats the webpage like a digital space that users can explore using mouse interactions. My interactions with this website were led mainly by curiosity, and the little moments of delight created by unexpected interactions made me want to keep exploring. The landing page is an illustrated map of a village, and users can navigate between pages by clicking on items that light up on hover. One of the pages mimics a newspaper users can ‘clip’ from to download illustrated wallpapers, while another one is a ‘shop’ that leads to a more traditional ecommerce site. How cute and fun!

            Another interesting website I found was a <a href="https://untamedheroinegame.maxmara.com/">platformer game</a> created by clothing brand Max Mara to promote a seasonal fashion line. This one also treats the page like a digital space, but the user explores by manipulating an avatar rather than using their mouse itself. This one creates intrigue using a vague narrative that accompanies the user as they move through the site, and the user can reveal more about the story by collecting fashion-themed items along the way. Some of the physics were a bit off, which made playing the game tedious, and although an interesting and beautifully illustrated experience, I was very disappointed when the reward for completing the game was a form to subscribe to an email newsletter. That’s just advertising though!
